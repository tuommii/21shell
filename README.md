# 21sh

Sh

## Debug
```sh
valgrind ./21sh --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes
```

## To-do

### Parsing
- [ ] Single quotes parsing
- [ ] IO numbers (2&1> null etc stuff)
- [ ] Handle signals for execve (etc. cat + CTRL+C exits only cat)

### History (for 42sh at least)
- [ ]			Save history to file
- [ ] `CTRL+R`	Incremental search from history
- [ ] `fc`		Opens latest command in editor and runs that after closed
- [ ] `!!`		print last command
- [ ] `!ls`		execute last command where ls is found
- [ ] `!1`		nth command without params, not in bash?
- [ ] `!-3`		nth command with params

### Misc
- [ ] Output **colors** e.g for ls
- [ ] Dynamic prompt (at least showing current folder)
- [ ] **Paste** text to shell from outside (in 42sh **popen** is allowed)


test cmd
```sh
mkdir test ; cd test ; ls -a ; ls | cat | wc -c > fifi ; cat fifi
```
